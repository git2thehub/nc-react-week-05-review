## Networking essentials
* network protocols establish how computers communicate over a network

### Examples
* `TCP`
  * TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.
  * One of the most commonly used protocols 
  * TCP organizes data so that it can be transmitted between a server and a client. It guarantees the integrity of the data being communicated over a network. Before it transmits data, TCP establishes a connection between a source and its destination, which it ensures remains live until communication begins. It then breaks large amounts of data into smaller packets, while ensuring data integrity is in place throughout the process.
* FTP - sending files, filezilla
* IP - 22.354.0.33 - 127.0.0.1 (local)
* SMTP - for working with email
