### What is a HTTP status code?
* An HTTP status code is a message a website's server sends to the browser to indicate whether or not that request can be fulfilled. Status codes specs are set by the W3C. Status codes are embedded in the HTTP header of a page to tell the browser the result of its request.
* The codes help identify the cause of the problem when a web page or other resource doesn't load properly.
